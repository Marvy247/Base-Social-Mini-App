TipChain App – Overview
Goal: Enable users to send tips via MiniKit inside the feed, forming viral "chains" that grow over time. Chain stats (length, top participants, etc.) are tracked onchain.

✅ Workflow
1. Design the Smart Contract (with Foundry)
📦 Core contract: TipChain.sol
👇 Responsibilities:
Handle receiving tips (in ETH or ERC20).

Track tip chains (tipId → chain of addresses).

Limit each address to 1 tip per chain.

Emit events for front-end updates.

Calculate and store chain stats (length, top tipper, etc.).

🧪 Test with Foundry:
Simulate tipping, replay chains, prevent double-tipping.

Use forge test, fuzzing, and invariant checks (e.g., total tips match funds).

2. Optional: Reward Mechanism
Add gamification:

Onchain badges/NFTs for reaching a chain length.

Optional mintNFT(address, chainId) function for participants.

Use Base minting infra (e.g., Zora, BasePaint, or custom).

3. MiniKit Frontend Integration
Use MiniKit SDK to build a UI inside Farcaster.

Show chain preview: "Alice tipped Bob → Bob tipped Carol".

Button: “Tip and continue the chain”

Load chainId from cast context or start new.

✅ MiniKit + Contract Flow:
Load current cast context via MiniKit.

Check if user is already in this chain.

Display chain data (originator, chain length).

Call tip(chainId) on button press.

Show confirmation toast or Farcaster reply.
